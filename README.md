This repository contains a referential standalone pytorch implementation of auto-regressive decoding and speculative decoding. All in [main.py](./main.py).
## Features
+ Support common sampling strategies such as greedy search, temperature sampling and top-p sampling.
+ Verified output distribution integrity(check this by setting temperature to 1e-8).
+ Verified speed up gain using various target/draft model pairs.
+ Colored visualization

## Example Usage
```bash
python main.py \
        --prompt "Below is a piece of Python code to efficienctly compute the n-th Fibonacci number using cache(a lookup table):\n" \
        --temperature 1e-8 \
        --top_p 1.0 \
        --max_new_tokens 80
```
